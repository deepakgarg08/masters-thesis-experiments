# Age Estimation Project

This project is focused on age estimation using deep learning models. It includes both a manual model reference and an LLM-based model.

## Manual Model Reference

The manual model reference can be found at the following GitHub repository: [Pytorch-Age-Estimation](https://github.com/manhcuong02/Pytorch-Age-Estimation.git).

## LLM-Based Model

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from the following link: [UTKFace Dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/). Once downloaded, set the `dataset_path` to `'UTKFACE-ALL'` at line #76 in your script.

### Requirements

- Python version: 3.8.16

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To run the model, execute the following command:
```bash
python your_script.py
```

Make sure to replace `your_script.py` with the actual script name you are using.
